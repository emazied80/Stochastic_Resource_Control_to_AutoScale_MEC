# Stochastic_Resource_Control_to_AutoScale_MEC
This project introduces a stochastic resource control optimization model to allocate processing resources (CPUs/GPUs) at the edge for a case study of RAN slicing workload, i.e., LDPC decoding algorithm. LDPC decoding algorithm is modeled by asymtotic analysis to determine number of arithmetic operations. Peak performance of edge architecture is modeled by using Roofline parameters. CPLEX OPLIDE (.mod) and data (.dat) files are included.
